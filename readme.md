# Speckle Server

> This is the Speckle Server, which coordinates communications between the various SpeckleClients.
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/74043433.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/74043433)

Speckle Server provides :
- a basic accounts system
- stream coordination
- design data collation and retrieval
- live update events
- a basic querying mechanism

## Deploy

Prerequisites:  
- A machine running [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#download).
- Have `git` installed too. 

Please note: the speckle server application is a clustered service that will spawn as many instances as you have CPU cores. 

Steps: 
1) Clone this repository and change your working path to this repository: 
`git clone https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleServer.git` then `cd SpeckleServer`. 

2) Run `docker-compose up -d`. This will take a bit of time at first. To stop the service, run `docker-compose down`.

3) Visit your speckle server [http://localhost](http://localhost) or whatever the IP address of your VPS is.

### Deploying to Heroku

    $ heroku create --stack cedar
    $ heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox
    $ heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku open

### Deploying on Debian-based OSes (Ubuntu etc)

1) Install mongodb, redis servers and npm: 

       sudo apt-get install mongodb redis npm

2) If you don't want both the redis and mongo servers running all the time (For ex. if you are just testing), disable both startup scripts (If you wish to leave both running automatically, skip to step 4):

       sudo systemctl disable mongodb
       sudo systemctl disable redis-server`

3) And stop both mongo and redis processes that were started automatically by apt-get: 

       sudo systemctl stop mongodb
       sudo systemctl stop redis-server

4) Clone SpeckleServer and run npm to install the needed nodejs packages: 

       git clone https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleServer.git
       cd SpeckleServer
       npm install

5) Edit config.js and adjust the mongo url line and the redis url line: 

       url: process.env.MONGODB_URI || process.env.MONGO_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/speckle'
       url: process.env.REDIS_URL || 'redis://localhost:6379'
    
6) Start mongo (create a folder somewhere to store the db): 

       mongodb --dbpath /path/to/some/folder
    
7) Start redis in another terminal: 

       redis-server
 
8) Check that both mongo and redis are running OK and that you can connect to them with these two clients:

       mongo
       redis-cli
    
9) Start Speckle in a third terminal: 

       node server.js

## Develop
More detailed instructions coming soon. Simply spin off an instance of Redis & Mongo locally, make sure in `config.js` that you're connecting to them, and spin out the server with `nodemon server.js` if  you want live reloads or `node server.js` otherwise. 

## API
[API docs are here](https://speckleworks.github.io/SpeckleOpenApi/#introduction) - they are a good overview of what you can do with the speckle server.

### Current limitations
SpeckleServer currently imposes a default payload size limit for streams, they are as detailed below.

Single object payload restricted before deflation, but this can be adjusted. Current limit :
- `2e6 bytes` : `2,000,000 bytes` or `2,000 KB` 

Max total payload size is currently restricted at 
- 1 payload of `50e6 bytes` : `50,000,000 bytes` or `50,000 KB` or `50 MB` or
- 100 payloads of around `500KB` each
